		<p> First of all welcome to my website. Me and my friends decided to go on a bike trip to a place which is above Kalanki situated on the southern part of kathmandu valley. We were in a total of about 5 friends and we reached there in about one hour from our meetpoints. The place was new for all of us and we decided to explore a bit about it. Later we came to know that the place was suitable for drag racing so we started racing. First of all we five friends were only there racing but later we were accompanied by the locals who also participated and entertained us. Among us there was a photographer friend who captured many different glimpse of moments which I've kept here in the gallery page.  </p>
